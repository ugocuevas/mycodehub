The first (and the most crucial) movie in the Harry Potter Franchise is certainly one it's best- 
it happened to be my first exposure to the world of Harry Potter and the lifelong obsession that was about to follow. 

The first shot of Hogwarts- immediately mesmerizing with it's tall towers and windows glimmering with candle-light as the bewitching 
soundtrack by John Williams plays- is a testament to how well the film is made. Minor details like the gorgeous mountains and lakes 
that surround Hogwarts lurk in the background or at the edges of the frames and make the whole thing dreamier, and magical. It's all 
so enchanting that one doesn't nitpick the special effects (which while being perfectly good for that time, seem a bit funny today).
The credit for this certainly goes to JK Rowling more than any one person because it's such a well realised world- it's the details 
of her imagination, after all, that the movie brings on the screen. The story is- as we know- one of the most interesting ones ever 
told in our lifetimes.
The casting certainly helps- the actors have been chosen less to accurately portray the physical features of their respective 
characters than to innately exude particular energies- Alan Rickman as Snape looks evil before he utters a word; Emma Watson as 
Hermoine looks honest and sincere; McGonagall looks like the phenomenal character that she is- and at the center of it all is Daniel
 Radcliffe- who makes the part his own- no one else could have been Harry Potter in a million years.
